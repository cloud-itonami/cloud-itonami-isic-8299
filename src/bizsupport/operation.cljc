  "OperationActor — one decompose/assign/disclosure/dispute operation = one
  supervised actor run, expressed as a langgraph-clj StateGraph. The
  advisor (TaskRouter-LLM) is sealed into a single node (:advise); its
  proposal is ALWAYS routed through the RoutingGovernor (:govern) and the
  rollout phase gate (:decide) before anything commits to the SSoT or is
  disclosed.

  Everything the actor depends on is injected, so each is a swap, not a
  rewrite:
    - the Store    (MemStore | DatomicStore | kotoba-server) — `store` arg
    - the Advisor  (mock | real LLM)                          — :advisor opt
    - the Phase    (0→3 rollout)                              — :phase in ctx

  One graph run = one operation (intake → advise → govern → decide →
  commit | hold | approval). No unbounded inner loop — each operation is
  auditable and checkpointed.

  Human-in-the-loop = real approval / dispute-review workflow:
  `interrupt-before #{:request-approval}` pauses the actor and hands the
  decision to a human reviewer (ops manager). The reviewer resumes with
  `{:approval {:status :approved}}` (or `:rejected`)."
